    <p>Released in Shetland White, Daisy Yellow and Caribbean Red variants, the Motocompo was introduced as a "trunk bike" (trabai) to fit inside subcompact cars like the Honda Today and the (then new) Honda City.[1] The City's baggage compartment was actually developed around the <em><strong>Motocompo</strong></em>. The handlebars, seat, and foot-pegs fold into the scooter's rectangular plastic body to present a clean, box-shaped package of 1,185 mm × 240 mm × 540 mm (46.7 in × 9.4 in × 21.3 in).     <img src="https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/1985_honda_city_r_wmotocompo_153645596993c1c474674751f9IMG_E5397.jpg?fit=940%2C626" alt="little bike">
<em>It is the smallest scooter ever built by Honda.</em> The company's initial monthly sales projection for the domestic market was 8,000 City and 10,000 Motocompo.[3]<br><br>
  <hr>
 The City surpassed its targets, but in all only 53,369 Motocompos were sold by the end of production in 1983 <small>(no more than 3,000 per month)</small>.[4] The scooter was marketed in conjunction with the City in television ads featuring British ska/2-tone band Madness.[5]</p>
